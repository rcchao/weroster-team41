  - iOS Simulator (included with Xcode)
  - CocoaPods - Install: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
  - Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

- **Android Development**:
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (latest version)
  - Android SDK (API level 33 or higher)
  - Android Emulator or physical Android device
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
  - Configure Android environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME`, etc.)

### Optional but Recommended

- **Maestro** (for E2E testing) - [Installation Guide](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)
  - Or run: `npm run maestro:setup`

### Environment Setup

- For Android development, ensure `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) is accessible from your terminal
- For iOS development on physical devices, you'll need an Apple Developer account

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weroster-team41.git
cd weroster-team41
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm run installs
```

This command installs dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/weroster"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
# Optional: Seed the database
npx prisma db seed
cd ..
```

### 5. Platform-Specific Setup

Choose your target platform and follow the appropriate setup instructions:

---

## 🍎 iOS Setup (macOS only)

### Step 1: Install Xcode

1. Download Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
2. Open Xcode and complete the initial setup
3. Accept the Xcode license agreement:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Step 2: Install iOS Simulator

1. Open Xcode → **Settings** (or **Preferences**) → **Platforms**
2. Download **iOS 18.4 Simulator** (or your preferred iOS version)
3. Wait for the download and installation to complete

### Step 3: Verify Simulator Installation

List available simulators:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices
```

You should see a list of installed iOS simulators.

### Step 4: Install CocoaPods Dependencies

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Step 5: Run the App

```bash
npm run ios
```

**Note:** The first build may take 10-15 minutes. Subsequent builds will be faster.

#### Optional: Manually Boot a Simulator

```bash
# Boot a specific simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"

# Open Simulator app
open -a Simulator
```

## 🤖 Android Setup

### Step 1: Install Android Studio

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Run the installer and complete the setup wizard
3. During setup, ensure you install:
   - Android SDK
   - Android SDK Platform
   - Android Virtual Device (AVD)
4. Accept all license agreements when prompted

### Step 2: Configure Android Environment Variables

Add the following to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc` for Zsh or `~/.bashrc` for Bash):

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
```

**Why is this needed?** Unlike Xcode (which auto-installs to standard macOS locations), Android SDK can be installed anywhere, so we need to explicitly define these paths.

Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 3: Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD)

1. Open Android Studio
2. Click **More Actions** → **Virtual Device Manager**
3. Click **Create Device** (or select an existing device)
4. Choose a device definition (e.g., Pixel 6)
5. Select a system image (e.g., API 34 - Android 14)
6. Click **Finish**
7. Start the emulator by clicking the **▶ Play** button

### Step 4: Verify Android Setup

Check that ADB recognizes your emulator:

```bash
adb devices
```

You should see your emulator listed (e.g., `emulator-5554`).

### Step 5: Configure Port Forwarding

If testing on a physical device or encountering connection issues:

```bash
npm run adb
```

This forwards the necessary ports for backend communication.

### Step 6: Run the App

```bash
npm run android
```

**Note:** The first build may take 10-15 minutes. Subsequent builds will be faster.

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### iOS Issues

**Problem:** `xcrun: error: unable to find utility "simctl"`

- **Solution:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

**Problem:** `CocoaPods could not find compatible versions`

- **Solution:** Update CocoaPods: `cd ios && pod repo update && pod install`

### Android Issues

**Problem:** `ANDROID_HOME is not set`

- **Solution:** Verify environment variables are correctly set and restart your terminal

**Problem:** `[CXX1101] NDK at /path/to/ndk did not have a source.properties file`

- **Solution:**
  1. Open Android Studio → **Settings** (⌘,) → **SDK Manager** → **SDK Tools** tab
  2. Check **Show Package Details** (bottom right)
  3. Find the NDK version mentioned in the error (e.g., 27.1.12297006)
  4. Install that specific NDK version
  5. Click **Apply** and wait for installation
  6. Retry: `npm run android`

**Problem:** `No connected devices` when running `adb devices`

- **Solution:** Ensure your emulator is running. Start it from Android Studio's Device Manager

**Problem:** `Metro bundler connection issues`

- **Solution:** Run `npm run adb` to configure port forwarding

## ▶️ Running the Application

After completing platform-specific setup, you can use these commands:

```bash
# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run backend only
cd backend && npm run dev

# Run everything concurrently (backend + iOS + Android)
npm run start
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once the app is running, you can:

- Login with test credentials (see [Testing](#-testing) section)
- Explore the calendar and roster features
- Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
